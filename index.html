    <h1 style="text-align:center">I'm bored rn ü•≤</h1>
    <p style="text-align:start">So, while we're here, what should we talk about?</p>
    <p style="text-align:end">Music? Games? Maybe even coding?</p><br>
    <p>Maybe I'll make a silly little web design portfolio üëÄ</p>
    <p>Well, not a portfolio of course, more of a list! So, in that case, I guess I should bring up the things I've made so far!</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><a href="https://jaysplace.neocities.org" target="_blank">Jay's Place</a></h2>
    <img src="/images/jaysplace.png">
    <p style="text-align:start">First thing's first, and I mean that literally! The first website I ever made was Jay's Place! The whole site is in disguise as a younger version of one of my self-insert OC's, and honestly, it's pretty fun!</p>
    <p style="text-align:start">I made other small sites with website builders before, but this was the first one I made by coding it! This site was sort of where I learned the basic parts of HTML and CSS, and getting to experiment with the shrines definitely helped me learn more about layouts.</p>
    <p style="text-align:start">I recently did a pretty big overhaul to the layout, and I think it's probably one of my favorite sites that I've made!</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><a href="https://baileylockheart.neocities.org" target="_blank">Bailey Lockheart</a></h2>
    <img src="/images/baileylockheart.png">
    <p style="text-align:start">I really love this one! It's a website mainly intended to house links and promote my music, but I also learned a lot while making it!</p>
    <p style="text-align:start">This site is what really kicked off my recent coding hyperfixation - getting to work on a personal website and make sure every element was in my control really inspired my inner control freak üòçüòç</p>
    <p style="text-align:start">Jokes aside, though, I initially made this website in Carrd and thought it looked cool. I decided to code something similar, and it came out so well that I decided to delete the Carrd entirely - this one's really where it's at.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><a href="https://maddsbuckleyfansite.meowandsparkle.party" target="_blank">Madds Buckley Fansite</a></h2>
    <img src="/images/maddsbuckleyfansite.png">
    <p style="text-align:start">I'm actually a bit worried about this one? I used her brand kit to make it look nice, and I intend to add photos and videos later, but apparently ALL of that could potentially be copyright infringement ü•≤</p>
    <p style="text-align:start"><a href="https://va.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_sa1zuoidCK1a4vsuh.mp4" target="_blank">I already know she's chill with me using her brand kit,</a> but I'm a little nervous about the photos and videos. Still, I really love this little project, and despite claiming it's for <i>other</i> fans, it's definitely for my own entertainment, too!</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><a href="https://thevoid-lockheart.netlify.app" target="_blank">The Void</a></h2>
    <img src="/images/thevoid.png">
    <p style="text-align: start;">Definitely the fastest thing I've ever finished, no questions there! Its sole purpose is basically to house your complaints about life and then discard them. Sort of like a place to vent, but it's ACTUALLY completely empty and there's no possible way for anyone to see it, even me. Plus, once it's gone, it's gone - no way to get it back (as far as I know), and no one will ever see it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: start;">This was sort of just a way for me to make a fun little tool, as well as to mess around with things like importing fonts and customizing text areas!</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><a href="https://skztagram.netlify.app" target="_blank">SKZtagram</a></h2>
    <img src="/images/skztagram.png">
    <p style="text-align: start;">As if one fanmade site wasn't enough ü•≤ Anyway, this site is intended to look similar to Instagram DMs, so you can rant to a member of Stray Kids, get no response, and erase it all at your leisure. I made this because I can't DM any of them, while other people can, and I wanted a solution so that I could at least pretend to.</p>
    <p style="text-align: start;">This is <i>very much</i> a WIP, but I think it's coming out pretty well so far! It's my first time really messing around with JavaScript and actually trying to comprehend what it's about, but it'll all make sense eventually. I hope.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><a href="/webmastery.html" target="_blank">Webmastery Tools</a></h2>
    <img src="/images/webmasterytools.png">
    <p style="text-align: start;">This isn't even really a SEPERATE site so much as it is an addition to this one, but I made a little thing so I can make more websites a little more easily! Additionally, this is meant to be helpful, so anyone can use it if they want to!</p>
    <p style="text-align: start;">This one's gonna probably get lots of updates as I get more things and as I improve at all this coding stuff in general, but we'll see how it goes!</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><a href="https://dont-click-this.itch.io/a-different-place" target="_blank">A Different Place</a></h2>
    <img src="/images/adifferentplace.png">
    <p style="text-align: start;">This one's a little interesting, since it's actually an itch.io EP! I initially just wanted a reason to play around with audio elements, but then I decided to upload it, since I love the platform and want to add to it, but I'm not a game dev.</p>
    <p style="text-align: start;">There are tools available to make better-looking pages for your music, and I may or may not end up using them in the future, but this was a way for me to try out making my own!</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><a href="https://baileylockheart-carrd.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Carrd (Dupe)</a></h2>
    <img src="/images/carrd-dupe.png">
    <p style="text-align: start;">I said I used to have a carrd, right? Well, I did, and it was fun while I had it. I had it in my Threads bio, since I wanted to be like my moots and I thought it would be fun. HOWEVER. The element limit was infuriating. So, I took matters into my own hands, and made one, myself!</p>
    <p style="text-align: start;">I actually asked my first question on Stack Overflow to get this how I wanted it, which made me nervous, but now it works just how I want it to!</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><a href="index.html" target="_blank">AND OF COURSE, THIS SITE!!!</a></h2>
    <img src="/images/imbored.png">
    <p style="text-align:start">If you click the link, it'll just reopen this same page in a new tab! I made this site mostly out of boredom, and it is the simplest of simple. I'm literally sitting in the middle of a classroom as I type this. Honestly, I was really surprised at how well this came out, since I made it in a chromebook text editor instead of my usual VSCode. Yet, for its simplicity, it came out well! I have a problem, but I adore it.</p>
    <h3>And those are all the things I've coded so far!</h3>
    <p style="text-align:start">However, it's not all the websites I've made - not exactly. I have a few other things under my belt in terms of designing with web builders, as well! Maybe they're not as impressive, but I still think they're pretty cool!</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><a href="https://baileylockheart.notion.site/Desktop-Threads-Themes-652a17d70f11463e96e24545740f784f?pvs=4" target="_blank">Desktop Threads Themes</a></h2>
    <img src="/images/threadsthemes.png">
    <p style="text-align:start">I recently decided, while on Threads on desktop, that it wasn't visually appealing to me. I opened up Firefox's web developer tools, and instantly, I saw a way to change that.</p>
    <p style="text-align:start">This is a little notion page, in which I'm holding together the CSS I used to restyle Threads's website to my liking! It's a fun and silly way to mess around with colors, and it also makes it more fun to use Threads's desktop version!</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/shifting-things" target="_blank">Shifting Things</a></h2>
    <img src="/images/shiftingthings.png">
    <p style="text-align:start">That's right, I had an interest in reality shifing! To be fair, I'm an anime enjoyer AND a K-pop stan, are we really surprised? Anyway, I haven't updated this in a while, and I'm not as passionately interested in shifting anymore, but I still like the color, at least üòÖ</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/bailey_lockheart/" target="_blank">Scratch</a></h2>
    <img src="/images/scratch.png">
    <p style="text-align:start">This one is a weird sort of middle ground? It actually took me an hour before I decided I should actually put it here, but I ended up going with it! Scratch is a place for coding, after all, so while my projects there might not be web design, exactly, it's still pretty neat!</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><a href="https://baileylockheart.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr Blog</a></h2>
    <img src="/images/tumblr.png">
    <p style="text-align:start">Am I too used to microblogging for my own good? Perhaps. HOWEVER. That has not stopped me from at least attempting to start a Tumblr blog - I'll figure out what I want to do there eventually, but for now, I just want to mess around with the custom themes!</p>
    <p style="text-align:start">Playing around with Tumblr's variables was very interesting, and I ended up with a pretty nice theme, in my opinion!</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>OKAY, I'M ACTUALLY DONE THIS TIME üò≠</h2>
    <p style="text-align:start">I got very excited about this ü•≤ Anyway, I'll probably keep adding to this as I do things, so we'll have to see how that goes! I'm knee-deep in a web dev hyperfixation, so this is what I do instead of school, I guess üò≠</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Also also! If you wanna link back to this weird little list, here's the way to do so ^-^</p>
